Buster D-Star Reflector Client for MacOS X

Buster is a MacOS client to connect to D-STAR reflectors and repeaters via the Internet.  It is written in
Objective C using native MacOS X technologies.  Buster is intended to do a few things and do them really well.
New features will be carefully considered to evaluate whether they are merely taking care of rare edge cases or
including functionality that is useful to a wide variety of users and does not ruin the simplicity of the
application's use.

I request that you use GitHub to file any issues about the software, this allows us to track the issues to their
conclusion.  This also goes for enhancement requests and any questions about the software.  If you file an issue
we can capture any conversation that happens about it for future use and abuse.  It's easy enough to close issues
that we don't intend to handle for whatever reason.

That being said, I'm not here to help you build Buster.  If you decide to compile from source, I assume that
you're a big boy or girl and don't need handholding compiling source code.  If you are having difficulty compiling
the code, I suggest that you explore the binary distributions.

I will accept pull requests from folks who fork other branches.  Any pull requests that implement features or
functionality that conflicts with Buster's aforementioned goal of being simple will be rejected or requested to be
reworked.  Becaue of the requirements of Apple's App Store, which is required for some of Buster's functionality,
you will be asked to sign a contributor's agreement that will allow me to submit your contributions to the App Store.

You, of course, are welcome to fork your own version of Buster subject to the licensing requirements.  The license,
however, does not grant you the usage of the term "Buster" in connection with the software.  I consider this a
common law trademark.  This means that you cannot name your fork "Buster" or any other derivative of "Buster" such as
"Buster HD", "Buster ng", "Buster++" and so forth.  The intent of this provision is to make sure that the term "Buster"
is associated only with my "official" code so that I don't have people asking me questions about your code.  In
essence, it's an attempt to have only "real Coke" labelled as "Coke."

If you have any questions, you are more than welcome to contact me.  Hopefully you find the software useful in some
way.
